# MC-Kelp-Money
A Minecraft resource pack replacing kelp with dollar bills.


### How to use this Resource Pack
To use this resource pack, simply copy the Kelp-Is-Money folder to your resource pack folder for minecraft. There are two ways to find the resource pack folder, one
way is through the game:
1) Within Minecraft, go to settings
2) Go into Options > Resource Packs
3) Click Open Pack Folder

Alternatively, without the game open:
1) Hit Windows Key
2) Type `run` and hit enter
3) Type `%appdata%` and hit enter
4) Click into the .minecraft folder, and the resourcepacks folder is in there.

### Trouble Shooting
- Make sure the resource pack is **above** the default texture pack, otherwise it will be overwritten.
- Use F3 + T to reload resource packs
